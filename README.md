    ```
4. make readable code:
   - short and meaning class name.
   - using media query for each class that have to be edit in another screen (below it).
   - using pseudo-class to select the element i need without creating to many classes.
   - using comment to tell this section of code for spicific section in website.
   - using css variables.

5. Using form and design it as PSD design.

6. Learn some Emmet use case in vs code to increase my typing speed.

### I learn a lot of thing in this project and now i be able to create a project with just UX&UI design without follow a tutorial.
